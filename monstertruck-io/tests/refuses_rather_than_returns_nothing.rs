//! An importer must never return an empty model where it means something else.
//!
//! The failure this guards against is specific: a caller writes
//! `let bodies = iges::from_path(p)?;`, gets `Ok(vec![])`, and concludes the file
//! held no geometry. That reading is wrong and silent, and it stays wrong until
//! someone compares against another tool.
//!
//! # This file used to assert the opposite
//!
//! Until the converter was written it asserted `Error::Unimplemented`, and that
//! row went **red on master** the day the conversion landed -- unnoticed, because
//! it is `#![cfg(feature = "iges")]` and the default-feature suite never compiles
//! it. Its failure message was the good news: *"returned Ok with 1 bodies"*.
//!
//! It is kept, rather than deleted, because the invariant it protects is not
//! about being unimplemented. The two ways to report "nothing" still have to stay
//! distinguishable from each other and from success, and now there is a third
//! thing to hold: that a real document converts.
